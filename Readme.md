This contains a couple of scripts for interacting with a rtl_sdr radio for timeshifting FM radio.

radio_recorder.sh - records rtl_sdr stream to mp3 files for later processing / uploading to a podcastgen server
radio_stream_to_icecast.sh - streams rtl_sdr feed to an Icecast server to listen on your LAN (or beyond if you dare!).
